    "At the start of the game, the Ghost's low Hot stat means that they aren't good at Turning Someone On. This plays into their core dilemma - without social power, how does the Ghost get the attention and emotional support that they need? Maybe they're endlessly giving, hoping for reciprocation. Helpful Spirit and Transference both point in that direction. Maybe they're mean and spiteful, assuming from the outset that they aren't worthy of affection. Unresolved Trauma and Projected Blame provide a different dynamic, suggesting a mean and spiteful Ghost who lashes out at those who remind them of what they've lost. Creep and Limitless add a voyeuristic element, encouraging the Ghost to ignore others' boundaries. Lots of other possibilities exist in the interactions between these moves, too.",
